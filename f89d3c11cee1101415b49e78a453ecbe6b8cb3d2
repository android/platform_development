You do that for LLVM, right?\n\nFor that matter, what rustc does this script use?  Does it specify one or does it use whatever\u0027s on the path?",

      "message": "This script calls cargo decided from these rules, and then the cargo picks rustc.\n\nYes, sometimes a developer will want a cargo not in the \"newest\" version directory.\nIn that case, the new \"--cargo_bin\" flag can be used.\nI think this \"default to newest version\" will be simpler to maintain than hard-code-and-manually-update the version number.",
