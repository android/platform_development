If so, you could get rid of the special case vendor check and just lop off everything after /data/local/tests/ and leave it as is.\n\nFor example, is the structure:\n\n/data/local/tests/vendor/XXX\n\nDoes the real library/test look like:\n\n/data/nativetest64/vendor/XXX\n\nI looked and /data/local/tmp does not appear to always be like this (at least for some of the tests I tried).\n\nI\u0027m not sure that there is a guaranteed way to find the right executable/shared library when a crash goes through a file in /data/local/tmp or /data/local/tests.",
