      "message": "These are for \"pass all -C flags to rustc in .bp files\" in the commit message.\nThe output for self.cap_lints and self.cfgs are not changed.\nThe self.codegens were not output, a bug, but luckily only 2 or 3 external/rust/crates were missing some non-critical -C flags. This change will fix that error and emit -C for them, except some that were already filtered out before this change.",
