Shouldn\u0027t these files live only in that repo?\n\nAlso, a benefit of the structured-json version (though it would be harder to implement) is that it would give you a generalized form of your main-module feature - you could parse Android.bp, then do a dictionary merge between the parsed value and the json value, then serialize it back out.",
