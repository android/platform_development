      "message": "Good point on this probably getting persisted to the Android.bp file.\n\ncat on error would work for me. As someone new to the tool it was very non-obvious how to debug anything, since I didn\u0027t know to look for a cargo.out (and in general I don\u0027t want extra steps to be able to see error messages for the thing I just ran). I\u0027d also be in favor of just showing output by default.\n\nlmk which you prefer.",
