      "message": "Yes.\n\nThese headers come from Khronos. https://www.khronos.org/registry/gles/\n\nThis isn\u0027t a problem in the platform (or for any program that uses GL) since anything that uses a GL extension will already have used GL and included the GL header. However, the NDK build system enforces this requirement.\n\nI will file a bug with Khronos to see if we can get this fixed upstream.",

They were both closed as \"Will not Fix - Working as Intended\" with the explanation that these headers are designed to be used together and including the extension header without first including the GL header is not valid.",
