This with the following soong.variables is only building 32-bit arm:\n\n{\n  \"DeviceName\": \"generic_arm64\",\n  \"Exclude_draft_ndk_apis\": true,\n  \"HostArch\": \"x86_64\",\n  \"Malloc_not_svelte\": false,\n  \"Ndk_abis\": true,\n  \"Platform_sdk_version\": \"30\",\n  \"Platform_version_active_codenames\": [\n    \"S\"\n  ],\n  \"Safestack\": false\n}\n\nThere doesn\u0027t seem to be much difference between what I have here and build-ndk-prebults.sh aside from the fact that build-ndk-prebuilts.sh does envsetup (but no lunch) and uses m. Neither of those seems to set up any environment that would account for the difference though.",

      "message": "Looking at the build.ninja the rules for the other architectures weren\u0027t generated. They *are* generated as part of the regular build though. It\u0027s either something different about using soong_ui directly instead of `m --skip-make`, or it has something to do with the many-ABI build itself. Not sure why that would be when the build-ndk-prebuilts.sh works fine though... will need to dig more.",
