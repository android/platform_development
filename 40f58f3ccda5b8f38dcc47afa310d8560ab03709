      "message": "lock/unlock can be greatly simplified because we will NEVER call lock with a non \"SW\" usage parameter. That is lock is only used to lock a buffer for SW access. Other values are illegal and should return an error.\n\nfurthermore, it is also illegal to lock a buffer for SW_WRITE if this buffer\u0027s usage is \"HW_RENDER\". That is we don\u0027t allow to SW render into a HW render buffer.\n\nin practice, lock is only called with SW_READ and/or SW_WRITE on buffers with usage bits of SW_READ | SW_WRITE | HW_TEXTURE.\n\nthat is, you should never have to read a h/w rendered buffer back for sw access.",
