Must be another skin you reused that had them in the corners.\n\nI think in your design it would be nice to have a row of buttons with [power] [vol-] [vol+] -- even with today\u0027s phones minimalist designs, these are bound to exist.\nOn earlier specific phone skins, they tried to match the side of the devices but that wasn\u0027t very discoverable imho. A simple horizontal row of buttons is just good enough and I believe we already have the pngs for them. It would be fine to omit phone dial/hangup at this point. Could be a 1.1 feature though.",
