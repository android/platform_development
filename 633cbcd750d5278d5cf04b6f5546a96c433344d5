      "message": "I don\u0027t think this is what we want. The intent is to build and run tests for all reverse dependencies and place them in TEST_MAPPING. So even if the crate that we\u0027re running cargo2android doesn\u0027t have tests, we still want to create a TEST_MAPPING file.\n\nDespite how annoyingly long Bazel takes, I think this is still better than not doing it, since this makes it so that TreeHugger builds/runs/tests reverse dependencies instead of the CL reviewer having to do it.",
