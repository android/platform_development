      "message": "Why do these samples still add the -mhard-float flags manually? Shouldn\u0027t these flags already be added automatically if building for the armeabi-v7a-hard target, making it redundant (and confusing) to add them manually here as well?",

      "message": "You are absolutely right.  Thanks for catching this.  Now I remember why the author checked for armeabi-v7a to force -mhard-float: sample Teapot and MoreTeapots and ndk_helper were written before API_ABI\u003darmeabi-v7a-hard was supported in ndk-build.  Now that ndk-build automatically add those flags for armeabi-v7a-hard, we should remove this check altogether.",
