      "message": "we can\u0027t use getAllManglings on templated (and not specialized) virtual functions, since getAllManglings gets thunk names as well for them. In order to produce thunks it needs to build a vtable. Vtables cannot be built for dependent records. As a result, it\u0027s probably better not to dump anything which is dependent at all. Following this for records/enums/globvars as well. This would probably mean that we would need to add -Iexternal/libcxx/include in our soong invocation so that we include all template instantiations from libc++, as they will not be dumped in libc++\u0027s dumps now.
