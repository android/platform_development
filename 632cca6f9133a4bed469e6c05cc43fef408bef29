      "message": "Do not use the legacy theme here. An update to the LinearLayout10 example should make it theme-independent. This will involve removing explicit @android:drawable references from linear_layout_10, using appropriate theme references to styles instead where relevant, and dealing with focusability/clickability on the resulting \"text field.\"\n\nIf you\u0027d like to simply update the other layouts already changed in this patch and leave the LinearLayout10 example alone for another day/patch, that\u0027s fine.",
